# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to my major project for CISC/CMPE 204 (Fall 2020)!

This project models the board game Connect Four in python using logical constriants 
Some of files were provided to us for the project (for example test.py was provided for us) but run.py, which contains the main code for the Connect Four Model, is all my own original handwritten code.

## Structure
* `run.py`: Connect Four Modeling Code
* `test.py`: This file confirms that my submission has everything required for the prioject and was provided to me.
